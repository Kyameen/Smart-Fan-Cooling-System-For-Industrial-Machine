# Smart-Fan-Cooling-System-For-Industrial-Machine
Smart Fan Cooling System: A MATLAB GUI and simulation for industrial machine cooling. Reads ambient and process temperatures in real-time, applies a PID-inspired control algorithm, and adjusts fan speed to maintain target setpoints. Includes open/closed-loop modes, live 3D plots, interactive sliders, safety limits, and input validation.
